Environmental Light Field analysis for use in Konstanz
====================
This repository contains files for [image analysis](https://github.com/JJFosterLab/ELF_Konstanz/tree/master/elf-master), written in ```MATLAB```, based on the **E**nvironmental **L**ight **F**ield ([ELF](https://github.com/sciencedjinn/elf)) system developed by Smolka & Nilsson (D.-E. Nilsson, J. Smolka, 2021 [Quantifying biologically essential aspects of environmental light.](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0184) _J. R. Soc. Interface_ 18: 20210184).  Image data (```.mat``` files) are available from [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0184). 


### Contributions:
 [ELF](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0184) was developed by J Smolka and D-E Nilsson. All ELF scripts written by J Smolka with conceptual input from D-E Nilsson. ```skypipe.m```, ```rotimdiffsky.m```, ```hmax.m``` and ```colourmapsky.m``` written by JJ Foster.

# System Requirements
